# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Moved Windows builds to .NET 10 LTS with an SDK pin, locked NuGet dependency graphs, deterministic warning-as-error builds, and Windows CI coverage.
- Updated the pinned WebView2 SDK and embedded x64 loader to stable 1.0.4129.50, with refreshed lock and redistribution metadata.
- Replaced direct publish-to-destination commands with isolated, allowlisted staging and transactional promotion so stale development files cannot leak into release folders.
- Added x64/version validation, SHA-256 manifests, redistribution notices, optional pre-manifest Authenticode signing, and post-promotion release verification.
- Added native WebView2 browser-extension support with Chrome Web Store URL/ID import, authenticated and bounded CRX3/CRX2/ZIP extraction, stable managed storage, unpacked-folder loading, declared-permission review, and an accessible install/list/enable/disable/remove manager.
- Made the address and search bar select its full current value whenever it receives focus or is clicked.
- Connected trusted **Add to Chrome** clicks to MishaWeb's verified native installer and added an **Install in MishaWeb** fallback on Store listings, avoiding WebView2's interrupted browser-owned download path.
- Added extension popup/options access from the manager and preserved the existing top-level JavaScript user-script feature as a clearly separate surface.
- Isolated private windows onto a dedicated InPrivate profile so normal-profile extensions cannot appear there.
- Added offline archive/signature/ownership hardening checks, a live WebView2 lifecycle probe covering install, disable, enable, profile persistence, private isolation, and removal, and a live Chrome Web Store download/install/remove probe using the actual runtime version.
- Fixed Messenger call buttons that open a temporary `about:blank` window by preserving WebView2 popup bootstrap URLs until the call tab is attached.
- Added direct per-site microphone and camera Allow/Ask/Block controls, request-time permission prompts, and Windows privacy-settings shortcuts.
- Kept camera/microphone-enabled tabs awake during calls, including while backgrounded or minimized.
- Preserved same-origin secure call signalling on any HTTPS site after microphone or camera access is granted, with narrow preflight compatibility for Messenger/Facebook, Discord, and Zoom while retaining the site shield for ordinary and third-party requests.
- Switched WebView2 tracking prevention from Strict to Balanced to preserve tracking protection without breaking real-time communication sites.
- Kept unfinished address-bar and start-page input intact, made bare `Enter` submit the typed Google search instead of an implicit history match, and limited direct suggestion navigation to explicit selection.
- Recovered signed-in YouTube playback from the inline `enforcementMessageViewModel` response with a bounded player retry, then removed the stale enforcement surface only after playable media returned.
- Added fail-open first-load recovery for YouTube's exact zero-buffer/zero-resolution “This content isn't available, try again later” transport stall, preserving explicit start times and never retrying live, captcha, mismatched, or ordinary unavailable videos.
- Expanded YouTube ad-metadata pruning to current player, playlist, watch, and get-watch payloads while restoring temporary recovery context after success.
- Prevented asynchronous background-tab suspension from touching or logging WebView2 controls that were disposed during tab teardown.
- Made Memory Saver's three most recently used ordinary sites a per-window no-discard resident set, so normal switching among frequently used pages never forces a refresh; Ultra-light may suspend them but cannot unload them.
- Added bounded Standard-mode cleanup for older inactive pages, verified-pressure acceleration, and capped failed-suspend retries so long sessions converge without periodic COM or diagnostic growth.
- Explicitly detached WebView2 core/frame/context-menu handlers and released hidden dialog tokens, pending COM-backed work, and suggestion indexes during navigation, replacement, hiding, and disposal.
- Prevented WebView2 frame-destruction callbacks from calling native event removers on an already-destroyed frame, eliminating the deterministic `0x80000003` breakpoint crash seen on iframe-heavy YouTube pages.
- Added an isolated private-profile tab-churn memory probe with post-cleanup plateau, slope, process, handle, and thread acceptance checks; it cannot run against or modify the normal browser profile.

## 2.2.0 - 2026-07-26

This performance and protection release keeps the compact pink bunny interface while reducing repeated CPU work and allocation in the browser's busiest native paths.

### Lightweight and fluid

- Added safe multicore managed-code startup profiling for faster repeat launches without prewarming WebView2, filters, tabs, or services.
- Replaced repeated nested start-page JPEG scaling with one bounded, shared 24-bit viewport frame; transparent descendants copy only their exact aligned slice, start-page tab switches reuse it, and the final hidden, minimized, or disposed page releases it instead of retaining about 4.5 MiB.
- Rebuilt local address suggestions around a state-aware index and bounded top-result selection. The 500-entry stress fixture fell from 1,223,208 to 832 allocated bytes per query while keeping the ranking checksum unchanged.
- Replaced allocation-heavy blocker candidate iterators, URI parsing, host suffix construction, regex-based compile indexing, and bad-filter option scanning with bounded caches and allocation-light scans.
- Stored singleton host/token buckets directly instead of allocating a list plus backing array for every filter key; the live 20-list fixture retained about 34.35 MiB, down from 43.44 MiB before the compact index pass.
- Kept the framework-dependent standard single-file package after measuring ReadyToRun: its small launch gain did not justify the larger executable and higher working memory.

### Stronger blocking without silent loss

- Expanded the verified filter catalog from 18 to 20 sources with Brave Unbreak and Brave first-party regional rules.
- Added conditional ETag/Last-Modified refresh metadata. Unchanged `304` responses no longer download list bodies or trigger recompilation, while last-known-good and atomic replacement behavior remain intact.
- Added compilation diagnostics for accepted network/cosmetic rules, unsupported candidates, and capacity drops. The release validation loaded 121,951 network and 31,409 cosmetic rules with zero capacity drops.
- Added a cache-miss benchmark with 4,096 unique request URLs in addition to the warm repeated-request benchmark.

### Verification and maintenance

- Added suggestion-index mutation tests, unique-URL and live-list blocker benchmarks, live capacity-drop gating, backdrop-cache ownership/disposal/offscreen-render tests, and console-safe test output.
- Updated product, assembly, package, manifest, documentation, and filter-download metadata to version 2.2.0.

## 2.1.5 - 2026-07-26

- Removed the “Light on memory. Built for the open web.” tagline and its reserved layout row.
- Reduced the central composition to a 680-logical-pixel maximum width with tighter logo, title, search, heading, and quick-link spacing.
- Added layout assertions that keep the composition compact and horizontally centered across DPI and window-size changes.

## 2.1.4 - 2026-07-26

- Made standard Memory Saver the default resource mode and added a one-time profile migration that preserves later manual mode changes.
- Removed the Lean browsing and Tab workspace cards from the start page to expose more of the bunny night-garden background.
- Reduced pinned and displayed quick links from six to three, producing a single focused row on normal-width windows.

## 2.1.3 - 2026-07-26

- Eliminated resize ghosting by making every custom search and start-page interaction surface paint a fully opaque frame instead of repeatedly alpha-compositing stale buffers.
- Added rounded clipping to the smart-search surface so child controls cannot escape its border at restored-window sizes.
- Added regression coverage that enforces opaque resize surfaces while retaining the transparent outer background composition.

## 2.1.2 - 2026-07-26

- Replaced unreliable WinForms child transparency with exact background-slice repainting, fixing the black outer composition in the real interactive window as well as off-screen renders.
- Made the search-glyph cell explicitly opaque and texture-free so no decorative bunny can bleed underneath it.
- Added production-source regression checks for the real-window painting path.

## 2.1.1 - 2026-07-26

- Removed the large outer start-page fill so the bunny night-garden artwork remains fully visible behind the floating content.
- Removed decorative bunny texture from beneath the smart-search glyph, leaving a clean standalone pink search icon.
- Added regression checks for both visual fixes and republished the versioned executable.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-07-26

This maintenance release restores the complete v2 interface after a frontend regression, keeps the lightweight native architecture, and introduces a new generated bunny identity.

### Frontend restoration and polish

- Restored the complete renderer-free start page: translucent feature card, tagline, live Lean browsing and Tab workspace chips, responsive six-item quick-link grid, contextual quick-link actions, and adaptive compact layouts.
- Reconnected quick-link population and refresh behavior in every native new tab, including saved-item management and local context actions.
- Replaced the old badge with a purpose-generated kawaii bunny logo across the start page, title bar, executable icon, and Windows shell sizes. The logo is decoded once from a compact embedded runtime asset; high contrast and decode failures retain the native vector fallback.
- Repaired responsive smart-search sizing so narrow windows genuinely enter compact mode instead of being silently clamped to desktop width.
- Removed corrupted UI glyphs and restored readable arrows, separators, ellipses, status text, private-window labels, and close controls.
- Hardened auxiliary dialogs, suggestion surfaces, and custom controls for high-DPI scaling, keyboard focus, high contrast, and usable on-screen bounds.

### Reliability and release safety

- Removed the smart-search catch-all fallback that could leave a partially initialized control tree or duplicate event handlers.
- Added geometry, generated-artwork, icon-frame, Unicode-integrity, responsive-DPI, and production-wiring regression coverage.
- Made every publish command run the strict build and smoke suite first, preventing a broken frontend from being packaged.
- Updated product, assembly, package, and documentation metadata to version 2.1.0.

## 2.0.0 - 2026-07-18

This release rebuilds MishaWeb around its two priorities: very low idle/resource cost and strong blocking that preserves normal site behavior.

### Resource efficiency

- Replaced the old multi-asset start-page package with one optimized 275 KB bunny night-garden backdrop, decoded once and shared process-wide. The richer new-tab experience remains renderer-free, static, and idle-work-free.
- Removed a redundant second WebView2 loader from the single-file bundle while retaining the verified embedded bootstrap copy.
- Reworked background-tab lifecycle planning into a bounded, allocation-light policy with pressure-aware discard, suspend, and low-memory targeting.
- Kept reduced website motion optional and compatibility-safe; it no longer replaces animation APIs or cancels page-owned animations.
- Streamed filter downloads into bounded temporary files, refreshed only stale sources, retained last-known-good lists, skipped recompilation when downloaded bytes are unchanged, and ignored unowned or oversized cache files.
- Reduced hot-path blocker allocations and bounded the cosmetic CSS cache by both entry count and total bytes.

### Blocking and compatibility

- Expanded parsing and regression coverage for network types, exceptions, third-party/domain constraints, Chromium conditionals, cosmetic rules, and `$popunder`.
- Made built-in whole-host safety rules third-party-only so directly visited sites and their first-party assets continue to load.
- Kept authored document rules effective while limiting shortener/redirect heuristics to redirected or scripted navigations; explicit visits remain usable.
- Scoped YouTube response filtering to known player/ad-metadata endpoints, leaving browse, search, comments, thumbnails, and media playback paths alone.
- Replaced continuous cleanup polling with mutation/event-driven cleanup plus adaptive, visibility-aware fallbacks.

### Interface and maintenance

- Re-established MishaWeb's pink identity with a modern deep-berry, blush, coral-pink, and soft-orchid native design across the frame, start page, suggestions, dialogs, menus, and feature surfaces.
- Evolved the v1 pink cosmic wallpaper into a modern bunny night garden with flowers, glowing ribbons, stars, hearts, a bunny moon, a sitting bunny, and two peeking friends; retained the native bunny badge and high-contrast fallback without animation or background work.
- Made the start-page smart search layout consistently DPI-scaled and its disabled controls fully opaque, preventing resize/maximize paint ghosts from appearing as overlapping controls.
- Made toolbar icon painting deterministic and DPI-aware: vector state no longer shares native button text, translucent layers clear cleanly between frames, and status yields before it can crowd the address bar or commands.
- Extended the global website theme beyond `prefers-color-scheme` with a reversible per-WebView automatic-dark renderer override, so explicitly light web apps such as Gmail and Drive follow dark mode while switching back to light clears the override without reloading pages.
- Added system high-contrast colors and focus treatment to the custom-drawn browser chrome.
- Updated product, assembly, package, documentation, and HTTP client metadata to version 2.0.0.
- Expanded strict smoke, compatibility, lifecycle, visual-render, and allocation benchmark coverage.
